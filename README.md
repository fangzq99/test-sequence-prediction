# capstone-project

- To open the GUI, run
```
npm start
```

- Electron application files are stored in the folder /src
- Model files are stored in the folder /nlp

- NOTE: None of the libraries used in the project are uploaded onto the repository, if you wish to run the GUI/Model, please install them manually. When working on the project, the libraries are installed on a Python virtual environment to keep my PC libraries organized and you may choose to do the same.
